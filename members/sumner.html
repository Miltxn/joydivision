            <p><h1>Bernard Sumner</h1></p>
            <p>Bernard Sumner (born 4 January 1956 at Salford, Lancashire) is a British musician, songwriter, vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and record producer. He is a founding member of the bands Joy Division and New Order.</p>
            <p>Sumner formed New Order with Peter Hook and Stephen Morris, ex-Joy Division in 1980 and became the leading protagonist of synthesizers in the electro-dance music scene, thereafter rave-techno. He is considered to be a pioneer of electronic music, post-punk, and techno.</p>

                <p><h2>Early life</h2></p>
                <p> distant relation of John Bird Sumner, he was born on 4 January 1956 in Broughton, Lancashire, England.</p>
                <p>Sumner was educated at Salford Grammar School, before joining Stop Frame as a television animator cartoonist.</p>
                <p><h2>Joy Division</h2></p>
                <p>Sumner was a founding member of Joy Division, formed at Salford in 1976. He and childhood friend Peter Hook both attended the fabled Sex Pistols concert at Manchester's Free Trade Hall on 4 June 1976 and whose music inspired them to perform together. Widely considered one of the most influential bands of the era, Sumner was lead guitarist (his main guitars were a Gibson SG and a custom Shergold Masquerader), as well as playing electronic keyboards and made his first vocal appearance on record singing the chorus of "Walked In Line" on the Warsaw album. In May 1980, after the suicide of its lead singer, Ian Curtis, Joy Division disbanded.</p>

                <p><h2>New Order</h2></p>
                <p>Sumner and remaining band members Peter Hook and Stephen Morris started a new band named New Order, joined by keyboardist Gillian Gilbert in October 1980. Though Hook, Morris and Gilbert also contributed vocals on some early tracks, Sumner emerged as the band's permanent singer and lyricist, alongside playing guitar and keyboards. Through a series of splits and reformations, the band has released nine studio albums.</p>
                <p><h2>Electronic</h2></p>
                <p>In 1989, Sumner joined up with former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr to form Electronic. The Pet Shop Boys' Neil Tennant collaborated on two tracks on their debut eponymous album, providing vocals. Sumner was their singer, guitarist, keyboardist and lyricist.</p>
                <p><h2>Bad Lieutenant</h2></p>
                <p>Bad Lieutenant included fellow New Order member Phil Cunningham and Jake Evans of Rambo & Leroy. Stephen Morris of New Order and Blur bassist Alex James also performed on the band's debut album. Sumner provided vocals, guitar and lyrics.</p>

                <p><h2>Other projects</h2></p>
                <p>In 1981, Pauline Murray and The Invisible Girls released their last single "Searching for Heaven", which included a guitar solo by Sumner, although he was not credited in the sleeves of its 7" and 10" edition at the time. In 1983, Sumner co-produced, with Donald Johnson, the single "The Great Divide"/"Love in a Strange Place" by the band Foreign Press. Foreign Press (aka Emergency) had had a long history with Sumner through both Joy Division and New Order.</p>
                <p>In 1990, he worked with former Factory Records label mates A Certain Ratio, remixing their song "Won't Stop Loving You". He has also recorded tracks with fellow Mancunians 808 State and Sub Sub. Sumner appeared as guest singer and guitarist (alongside Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie) on The Chemical Brothers' 1999 album Surrender, on the track "Out of Control"; and in a 2005 Chemical Brothers show at the Brixton Academy, Sumner appeared live onstage as a special guest on this track. He has also lent vocals and guitar to a track ("Miracle Cure") on German trance outfit Blank & Jones 2008 release, "The Logic of Pleasure". Sumner also appeared on the Primal Scream track "Shoot Speed Kill Light" from their 2000 album XTRMNTR.</p>

            <div class="text4">
                <p>He has produced several remixes for tracks such as Technotronic's "Rockin' Over the Beat" (which was featured in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III soundtrack) and served as a record producer and/or songwriter for other Factory Records acts including Happy Mondays (whose second single, "Freaky Dancin'," he produced in 1986), Shark Vegas, Abecedarians, 52nd Street and Section 25.</p>
                <p>In 2020, Sumner collaborated with composer/producer Zachery Allan Starkey on two singles, “Force” and “Fear City”, which were recorded for Starkey’s solo album, FEAR CITY, released in April 2020. Based in New York City, Starkey opened for New Order during the Music Complete Tour in 2016/2017, after which he and Sumner began to discuss a collaboration. Starkey and Sumner co-produced “Force” and “Fear City”, and Sumner provided synthesizers, guitar, keyboards, and drum programming on both tracks. The Starkey/Sumner collaborations received positive reviews from critics and were featured in Clash Magazine, The London Times, Under the Radar, Filter Magazine, and Brooklyn Vegan, amongst other publications.</p>
